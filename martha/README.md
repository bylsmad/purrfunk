# martha 

martha~ is a companion to the sigmund~ analysis object. It's designed to accept output from sigmund~'s sinusoidal tracking function, "tracks". In addition to providing an internal oscillator bank and doing all the data/voice bookkeeping, it has some useful features for independent glissing and amplitude pulsing of individual partials. martha~ is also capable of managing the attack and release times of partials and forcing inharmonic spectra to harmonic arrangements. Combined, these features can create a variety of interesting effects.
